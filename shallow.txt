In this paper, we 
have tried to
implement a singing voice 
that converts plain text into 
a song which is done 
by synchronization of a midi file
or the music with the
text. The majority of MIDI files 
are arranged as several
tracks and contain data that 
can be regarded as a 
symbolic representation of music
